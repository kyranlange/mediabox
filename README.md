### **PLEASE NOTE**

For simplicity's sake (eg. automatic dependency management), the method used to install these packages is Ubuntu's default package manager, [APT](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt).  There are several other methods that work just as well, if not better (especially if you don't have superuser access on your system), so use whichever method you prefer.  Continue when you've successfully installed all packages listed.

### Installation

(You'll need superuser access to run these commands successfully)

Start by updating and upgrading our current packages:

`$ sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade`

Install the prerequisite packages:

`$ sudo apt install curl git bridge-utils`

**Note** - Mediabox uses Docker CE as the default Docker version - if you skip this and run with older/other Docker versions you may have issues.

1.  Uninstall old versions - Itâ€™s OK if apt and/or snap report that none of these packages are installed.  
    `$ sudo apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc`  
    `$ sudo snap remove docker`  

2.  Install Docker CE:  
    `$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh`  
    `$ sudo sh get-docker.sh`  

3.  Install Docker-Compose:  

    ```bash
    sudo curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url" | grep -m1 `uname -s`-`uname -m` | cut -d '"' -f4 | xargs sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/1.24.1/contrib/completion/bash/docker-compose -o /etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose
    ```

4.  Set the permissions: `$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`  

5.  Verify the Docker Compose installation: `$ docker-compose --version`  

Add the current user to the docker group:

`$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

Adjustments for the the DelugeVPN container

`$ sudo /sbin/modprobe iptable_mangle`

`$ sudo bash -c "echo iptable_mangle >> /etc/modules"`

Reboot your machine manually, or using the command line:

`$ sudo reboot`

## Using mediabox

Once the prerequisites are all taken care of you can move forward with using mediabox.

1.  Create a user to run mediabox: `$ sudo adduser --no-create-home --shell /bin/false --group --system mediabox`

2.  Add user to the docker group: `$ sudo usermod -aG docker mediabox`

3.  Clone the mediabox repository: `$ git clone git@github.com:kyranlange/mediabox.git`

4.  Move to /opt: `$ sudo mv mediabox /opt/`

5.  Change directory into mediabox: `$ cd /opt/mediabox/`

6.  Add credentials needed for Kometa to `plex-meta-manager/config.yml` - see the [Docker Walkthrough](https://kometa.wiki/en/latest/kometa/install/docker) for more info.

7.  Run the mediabox.sh script: `$ ./mediabox.sh`  (**See below for the script questions**)

8.  To upgrade Mediabox at anytime, re-run the mediabox script: `$ ./mediabox.sh`

### Please be prepared to supply the following details after you run Step 3 above

As the script runs you will be prompted for:

1.  Your Private Internet Access credentials
    *   **username**
    *   **password**

2.  The version of Plex you want to run
    *   **latest**
    *   **public**
    *   **plexpass**

    Note: If you choose plexpass as your version you may optionally specify CLAIM_TOKEN - you can get your claim token by logging in at [plex.tv/claim](https://www.plex.tv/claim)

Upon completion, the script will launch your mediabox containers.

Portainer has been switched to the **CE** branch
* **A Password** will now be required - the password can be set at initial login to Portainer.
* **Initial Username** The initial username for Portainer is **admin**

### **Mediabox has been tested to work on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS / 20.04 LTS - Server**

## Day One Stuff

Once it is up and running, some configuration is required

### Homepage

To enable the widgets to work, some of them require an API key. To supply the API key, edit `homepage/services.yaml`. See https://gethomepage.dev/en/configs/service-widgets/ for information on how to get each of the API keys.
